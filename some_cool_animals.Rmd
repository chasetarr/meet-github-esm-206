##### A note on this project:

The organization of this document probably seems strange. That's because it's part of an entire multi-part lab for ESM 206, which students will create in multiple projects (but are combined here for easier sharing). Hence the weird unrelated pieces all put together in this project (students will create Parts 2 & 3 as separate projects).

### Cool animal fun facts {.tabset .tabset-fade} 
- .tabset tells the next header to be a tab under the cool animal fun facts

#### SHARKS!!!

##### Some great white shark facts (from [NatGeo Kids](https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/discover/animals/sea-life/great-white-sharks/)):

- Great white sharks have ~ 300 teeth
- And swim way faster than you (25 mph)
- And are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List

#### California condors 
- another tab because level 4 header under the OG level 3 when we told to tabset

##### Some California condor facts (from [Animal Fact Guide](https://animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/california-condor/)):

- By 1987, there were only 10 California condors living in the wild
- They are the largest flying bird in North America
- Critically endangered on the IUCN Red List (> 400 today)

#### American pika 
- another tab

##### Some American pika facts (from [OneKindPlanet.org](https://onekindplanet.org/animal/pika-american/)):

- Pika are of order *Lagomorpha* (which also includes rabbits)
- Pika live in high altitude talus slopes
- American pika are already disappearing from the Sierra Nevada

- lets say someone forgot to include a tab for ringtail cats
- we are going to add a new tab using a level 4 header based on hierarchy

#### Ring-Tailed Cats

Here would be where we would put information on ring-tails # saving updates in the git tab by the environment

![Ring-Tail Cat (courtesty of VA zoo)](img/ringtail_cat.jpg) - square brackets are caption for figure, parentheses are the image path - save and then knit to see new tab in document
- we will also learn about `knittr::include_graphics()` in the future
- staging files and then pressing committ - then push
- pressing pull when collaborating to make sure your version is up to date

Adding a few fun facts:
- Ring-Tail Cats can rotate hind legs 180 degrees (useful for climbing)
- Are not an endangered species just very illusive
- Closely related to Racoons
